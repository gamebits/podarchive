TODO
====
* More error handling
* Universal path separators (so it works on both Windows and UNIX)
* Progress bar
* RSS feeds could be very large, only download if necessary
* Also archive images embedded in the show notes
* Make HTML file nicer
* With the option --no-overview set, the HTML file will still be prepared, just not written. This wastes memory.
* Reasonable separation between logic and interface
* More options
    - File format
        - Don't append original filename
    - Ignore show notes
    - Make regex-cleaning of the filename optional
