====
* More error handling
* Progress bar
* RSS feeds could be very large, only download if necessary
* Also archive images embedded in the show notes
* Put the name of the podcast into the overview's <title> element
* Support split RSS feeds
* Different format for the overview: Just a list of episodes, each episode gets its own page which contains both the audio file and the show notes
* Reasonable separation between logic and interface
* More options
    - File format
        - Don't append original filename
    - Ignore show notes
    - Make regex-cleaning of the filename optional
