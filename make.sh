# The output file will be named "podarchive". It only works on the same operating system it was created on.

# More information about pp: https://metacpan.org/pod/pp

# pp fails to detect and include some necessary modules, these need to be added manually via the '-M' flags

# This was tested on:
# [x] macOS
# [x]Â Linux
# [x] FreeBSD
